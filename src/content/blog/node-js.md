## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is built on the **V8 JavaScript engine**, which powers Google Chrome, and allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting.

---

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations.
- **High Performance**: Uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript, making it fast and efficient.
- **Single-Threaded**: Operates on a single-threaded event loop to handle concurrent requests.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: NPM (Node Package Manager) offers thousands of open-source libraries.

## How Node.js Works

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for handling real-time, data-intensive applications. Here's a high-level workflow:

1. Client sends a request to the Node.js server.
2. Node.js handles the request asynchronously without blocking the thread.
3. When the operation (e.g., database call) is complete, the server responds.

## Use Cases

- Real-time web applications (e.g., chat apps, live updates).
- RESTful APIs.
- Server-side rendering.
- Microservices.
- IoT applications.
- Streaming applications.

## Installing Node.js

1. Download the Node.js installer for your operating system from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Follow the installation steps.
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v   # Check Node.js version
   npm -v    # Check npm version
   ```
