## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language built on top of JavaScript. It is developed and maintained by **Microsoft** and extends JavaScript by adding **static typing**. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all browsers and JavaScript environments.

---

## Key Features

- **Static Typing**: Enforces type safety at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Type Inference**: Automatically infers types when not explicitly defined.
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing JavaScript code.
- **ESNext Features**: Supports modern JavaScript features and provides compatibility for older environments.
- **Enhanced Tooling**: Offers powerful autocompletion, refactoring, and error-checking in IDEs.
- **Interfaces and Generics**: Facilitates building scalable and reusable code.

---

## Why Use TypeScript?

1. **Type Safety**: Catches type-related errors during development.
2. **Improved Productivity**: Better autocompletion and debugging tools.
3. **Scalability**: Ideal for large projects with complex codebases.
4. **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to understand and refactor code.
5. **Community Support**: Widely adopted and integrated into popular libraries and frameworks.

---

## Use Cases

- Large-scale enterprise applications.
- Frontend frameworks like Angular or React.
- Backend development with Node.js.
- Libraries and APIs requiring strict type definitions.

## Installing TypeScript

1. Install TypeScript globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
